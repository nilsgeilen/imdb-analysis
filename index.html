                Imdb classifies its items into different title types like <i>movie</i>, <i>tv movie</i> and
                <i>video</i>,
                which refer to films shown in cimena, those produced for television and those which are release
                direct-to-dvd respectively.
                This chart visualizes which categories your rated items come from.

                <question>Which are your favourite directors?</question>
                This chart lists the top ten directors according to their score. Alternatively directors can be sorted
                by the number of their films which you have rated or the average rating you gave their films.
                For all diagrams in this chapter, directors with only asingle rating are excluded, therefore only
                directors with at least two rated film are considered for the ranking.
                The score for a director <i>d</i> is computed in the following way, where <i>a</i> = <span
                    id="formula_yar"></span>
                is your average rating and <i>R<sub>d</sub></i> denotes
                all of your ratings for films by director <i>d</i>:
